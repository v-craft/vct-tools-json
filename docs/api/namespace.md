# **namespace**

This repository contains a single namespace: `vct::tools::json`

All components reside within this namespace.

You can import this module like this:

```cpp
import std;
import vct.tools.json;
```

**Note**: For brevity, the `vct::tools::` prefix will be omitted in subsequent documentation. This is equivalent to having:

```cpp
using namespace vct::tools;
```
